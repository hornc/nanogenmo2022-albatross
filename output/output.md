"Reading lists of letters used in the words of every sentence is tiring." thinks the reader, "Surely the whole book can't be like this?"

Yes, more of the same.
Exasperated, the reader jumps forward again, to page 13.
Midway on the page there is a quote, as if spoken by a character.
  "This is new..."

> 
"This flow of words and letters, recognizable yet not directly meaningful, has a somewhat soporific effect. There is a rhythm to them; a plodding familliarity, yet there is something alien, perhaps 
ominous. Where is it all leading? Is there anything to uncover, or is it all effectively empty terrain?"


It appears to be the narration of a reader's internal thoughts.
But which reader?
This hasn't happend.
Yet?

Immediately following the quote is a resigned resumption (the text on the page actually uses the words "resigned resumption") of the tedious sentence descriptions for 3 paragraphs:

## CHAPTER 6




From flicking through the pages earlier, the reader had noticed that chapter 9 starts with a number of statements about specific letters located throughout the book.
The first was that "The first letter on page 1 of this book is 'T'.".
This appears to be correct.
Then "The first letter on page 2 of this book is 's'.".
Glancing at the facing page, this too is verified as correct.
"The fifth letter of the second line on page 7 is 'a'."
Flicking forward 6 pages, the reader finds that the fifth letter of the second line is indeed 'a'.
