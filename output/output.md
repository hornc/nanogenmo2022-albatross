Then a compact curve with a small closed loop where the end of the curve joins back onto itself forming an eye. Then there is a gap.

Then there is a period, ending the current sentence.



The reader is lulled into a trance by the almost meaningless repetition of self-descriptive words.

Soon these too lose their meaning as symbols and there are just the shapes, printed in black ink on the paper:
First there appears a long vertical taking up the full height of the line with a horizontal cross bar at the very top. This is followed by a long vertical taking up the full height of the line with a curved hook protudence to the lower right. Then a compact curve with a small closed loop where the end of the curve joins back onto itself forming an eye. Then there is a gap. Then a short vertical stroke with a small curved hook at the top-right. Then a compact curve with a small closed loop where the end of the curve joins back onto itself forming an eye. Then a loop closing in on itself in a clockwise direction. Then a closed curve attached to a long vertical stroke. Then a compact curve with a small closed loop where the end of the curve joins back onto itself forming an eye. Next, a short vertical stroke with a small curved hook at the top-right. Then there is a gap. Next, a long vertical taking up the full height of the line with a curved hook protudence to the lower right. Then a loop closing in on itself in a clockwise direction. Next, a curvaceous symbol, with symmetrical bends one above the other. Then there is a gap. Next, a curved stroke, descending below the line, with a dot above it. Then a small curved symbol open at the top with a slightly straighter right side. Then a curvaceous symbol, with symmetrical bends one above the other. Then a long vertical stroke, slightly curved at the bottom with a crossbar. Then there is a gap. Then a long vertical stroke, slightly curved at the bottom with a crossbar. Then a small curved symbol open at the top with a slightly straighter right side. Then a short vertical stroke with a small curved hook at the top-right.

Then a long vertical taking up the full height of the line with a curved hook protudence to the lower right. Next, a compact curve with a small closed loop where the end of the curve joins back onto itself forming an eye. Then there is a gap. Next, a long descender, dropping below the line, with a closed curve to its right, sitting on the baseline. Then a loop closing in on itself in a clockwise direction. Then two linked loops, one above the other, the lower being slightly larger and below the baseline, and the upper sitting on the baseline and possessing a little ear on its righthand side. Then a compact curve with a small closed loop where the end of the curve joins back onto itself forming an eye. Then a point with a clockwise tail, sitting upon the baseline. Then there is a gap. Then a long vertical stroke with a curved hook protudence to the lower right. Then a loop closing in on itself in a clockwise direction. Then two short lines joining together at the base to form a sharp angle. Then a short vertical stroke with a dot above it. Next, a small curved symbol open at the bottom with a slightly straighter left side. Then two linked loops, one above the other, the lower being slightly larger and below the baseline, and the upper sitting on the baseline and possessing a little ear on its righthand side.

## CHAPTER 3





"CHAPTER 3" it reads at the top of page.
""CHAPTER 3"" begins the first sentence.
A twice-quoted "CHAPTER 3" begins the second sentence.
The third sentence does not begin with "CHAPTER 3", but contains it anyway.
As does the fourth.
The fourth sentence avoids it altogether.
As does the sixth.
And seventh.
And eighth.
And ninth, and so on.
The last three sentences begin with conjunctions, the reader notes, which make them improper sentences?
Does it matter?
It is not the worst sin committed by this book.
The fourteenth sentence mentions "CHAPTER 3" again — for no reason discernable to the reader.
From a quick glance through the remaining {pages} pages of this chapter it does not appear again.
This chapter _is_ referenced later, but the reader is not directly aware of this yet.
Having read and analysed the first fourteen sentences of this chapter the reader chooses to ignore the footnote at the bottom of this page and continue reading:

The reader scans through the pages looking for other interesting features. There is a single figure, an engraving, captioned "The Common Albatross (_Diomedea exulans_, Linn.)" on page 28.

There are footnotes on pages %footnotes%. The repetitive nature of the descriptions limit the vocabulary somewhat, and there is a pattern to the typography, which has its own
restricted character. Page ?? makes use of the word "façade", which contains a cedilla on the letter 'ç', which is a typographically interesting variation the reader is able to note.
"façade" is used in the book ?? times. Other than that, the typeface appears to be that of basic Latin characters.

From flicking through the pages earlier, the reader had noticed that chapter 9 starts with a number of statements about specific letters located throughout the book.
The first was that "The first letter on page 1 of this book is 'T'".
This appears to be correct.
Then "The first letter on page 2 of this book is 'r'".
Glancing at the facing page, this too is verified as correct.
"The fifth letter of the second line on page 7 is 'p'"
Flicking forward 6 pages, the reader finds that the fifth letter of the second line is indeed 'p'.


Chapter 9 also refers to this engraving:

![— The Common Albatross (_Diomedea exulans_, Linn.)](data/engraving.png)

and correctly notes this page number as being 28.

## CHAPTER 7





"This flow of words and letters, recognizable yet not directly meaningful, has a somewhat soporific effect. There is a rhythm to them; a plodding familliarity, yet there is something alien, perhaps 
ominous. Where is it all leading? Is there anything to uncover, or is it all effectively empty terrain?"

## CHAPTER 8





The reader is beginning to suspect that the title, "An Unfinished Novel of {wordcount} Words", and the engraving on page 28, with its reference to "The Common Albatross (_Diomedea exulans_, Linn.)", is a meaningless façade to give this book an illusion of hidden depth and meaning.

## CHAPTER 10





## The Last Day.

"What has happend?", the reader thinks.
"This is the last chapter, and I have skipped through multiple blank pages -- entire empty chapters in fact."

"I was expecting more."

"There was supposed to be a build-up of conflict between myself and the narrator."

"A potential existential battle of wills, where I experiemented with controlling the narrator, in a similar fashion to how the narrator appeared to be controlling _my_ actions."

"I was supposed to test the power of the narrator, and catch them out making mistakes in their narration. I needed a chance to explore both paths of being a _compliant reader_, and an _adverserial reader_."

"Where were these sections?"

"I don't feel like I have done and experienced these things fully."

"It seemed so promising." The reader sighs.

"The mystery of the Albatross was somewhat (barely) introduced, but never got off the ground." The reader frowns, uncertain whether they even _noticed_ there was an albatross (introduced with the engraving on page 28), or a mystery specific to it. Is this the narrator being overly presumptious? Have they been "caught out" right here?

"There were footnotes mentioned, but none appear in this version."

"There was supposed to be a nice cover, which tied into the Albatross mystery". The reader flips the book to the front -- the current cover is indeed blank.

"Up to this chapter there are only 32846 words. Everyone knows that is only 65.692% of a _real_ novel.", the reader thinks with disdain.

While the reader is thinking these thoughts, an albatross appears out of nowhere and nuzzles up to the reader's legs.

"MEOW." it says, apologetically.

The reader smiles and pets it on the head, not too condescendingly.

"At least you tried."

With that, the reader looks down at the page in front of them and begins to read the final chapter in order to complete this book:
