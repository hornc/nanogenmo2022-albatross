"Reading lists of letters used in the words of every sentence is tiring." thinks the reader, "Surely the whole book can't be like this?"
Frowning, they flick forward through the pages. A chapter heading briefly catches their eye: "Chapter 2".

Yes, more of the same.
Exasperated, the reader jumps forward again, to page 13.
Midway on the page there is a quote, as if spoken by a character.
  "This is new..."

> 
"This flow of words and letters, recognizable yet not directly meaningful, has a somewhat soporific effect. There is a rhythm to them; a plodding familliarity, yet there is something alien, perhaps 
ominous. Where is it all leading? Is there anything to uncover, or is it all effectively empty terrain?"


It appears to be the narration of a reader's internal thoughts.
But which reader?
This hasn't happend.
Yet?

Immediately following the quote is a resigned resumption (the text on the page actually uses the words "resigned resumption") of the tedious sentence descriptions for 3 paragraphs:

and so on...

But then the style changes to describing the _letter forms_, down to the curves and uprights of the type:

> First there appears an angular character; three lines forming two sharp angles. This is followed by a compact curve with a small closed loop where the end of the curve joins back onto itself forming an eye. Then two short lines crossing each other. Then a long vertical stroke, slightly curved at the bottom with a crossbar. Then there is a gap. Then a long vertical taking up the full height of the line, slightly curved at the bottom with a crossbar.

and so it continues — seemingly for many pages.
The reader shakes their head in bewilderment.


Flicking through the entire book, the reader notices that there are ten chapters.
The first ends here, so the reader turns the page.

The reader is lulled into a trance by the almost meaningless repetition of self-descriptive words.
The words begin to lose meaning, if they ever had any to begin with.

The letters flow past:

Soon these too lose their meaning as symbols and there are just the shapes, printed in black ink on the paper:
First there appears a long vertical stroke with a horizontal cross bar at the very top. This is followed by a long vertical stroke with a curved hook protudence to the lower right. Then a compact curve with a small closed loop where the end of the curve joins back onto itself forming an eye. Then there is a gap. Then a short vertical stroke with a small curved hook at the top-right. Then a compact curve with a small closed loop where the end of the curve joins back onto itself forming an eye. Then a loop closing in on itself in a clockwise direction. Then a closed curve attached to a long vertical taking up the full height of the line. Then a compact curve with a small closed loop where the end of the curve joins back onto itself forming an eye. Next, a short vertical stroke with a small curved hook at the top-right. Then there is a gap. Next, a long vertical stroke with a curved hook protudence to the lower right. Then a loop closing in on itself in a clockwise direction. Next, a curvaceous symbol, with symmetrical bends one above the other. Then there is a gap. Next, a curved stroke, descending below the line, with a dot above it. Then a small curved symbol open at the top with a slightly straighter right side. Then a curvaceous symbol, with symmetrical bends one above the other. Then a long vertical taking up the full height of the line, slightly curved at the bottom with a crossbar. Then there is a gap. Then a long vertical stroke, slightly curved at the bottom with a crossbar. Then a small curved symbol open at the top with a slightly straighter right side. Then a short vertical stroke with a small curved hook at the top-right. Then a small curved symbol open at the bottom with a slightly straighter left side. Then a compact curve with a small closed loop where the end of the curve joins back onto itself forming an eye. Next, a closed curve attached to a long vertical stroke. Then there is a gap. Next, a long vertical taking up the full height of the line, slightly curved at the bottom with a crossbar. Then a long vertical stroke with a curved hook protudence to the lower right. Next, a compact curve with a small closed loop where the end of the curve joins back onto itself forming an eye. Then there is a gap. Next, a long descender, dropping below the line, with a closed curve to its right, sitting on the baseline. Then a loop closing in on itself in a clockwise direction. Then two linked loops, one above the other, the lower being slightly larger and below the baseline, and the upper sitting on the baseline and possessing a little ear on its righthand side. Then a compact curve with a small closed loop where the end of the curve joins back onto itself forming an eye. Then a point with a clockwise tail, sitting upon the baseline. Then there is a gap. Then a long vertical taking up the full height of the line with a curved hook protudence to the lower right. Then a loop closing in on itself in a clockwise direction. Then two short lines joining together at the base to form a sharp angle. Then a short vertical stroke with a dot above it. Next, a small curved symbol open at the bottom with a slightly straighter left side. Then two linked loops, one above the other, the lower being slightly larger and below the baseline, and the upper sitting on the baseline and possessing a little ear on its righthand side. Next, there is a gap. Then a curved a long vertical taking up the full height of the line with a crossbar. Next, a short vertical stroke with a dot above it.

## CHAPTER 3





"CHAPTER 3" it reads at the top of page.
""CHAPTER 3"" begins the first sentence.
A twice-quoted "CHAPTER 3" begins the second sentence.
The third sentence does not begin with "CHAPTER 3", but contains it anyway.
As does the fourth.
The fourth sentence avoids it altogether.
As does the sixth.
And seventh.
And eighth.
And ninth, and so on.
The last three sentences begin with conjunctions, the reader notes, which make them improper sentences?
Does it matter?
It is not the worst sin committed by this book.
The fourteenth sentence mentions "CHAPTER 3" again — for no reason discernable to the reader.
From a quick glance through the remaining {pages} pages of this chapter it does not appear again.
This chapter _is_ referenced later, but the reader is not directly aware of this yet.
Having read and analysed the first fourteen sentences of this chapter the reader chooses to ignore the footnote at the bottom of this page and continue reading:


The next letter encountered is a capital 'F', followed by a lowercase 'r', followed by an 'o', then an 'm'.
The next word is 'a'. The reader nods again, and continues to read.
The next letter encountered is a lowercase 'q', followed by an 'u', followed by an 'i', followed by a 'c', then a 'k'.
Next there is a space followed by a new word: 'g' - 'l' - 'a' - 'n' - 'c' - 'e' -

The next word is 'is'. The reader nods again, and continues to read.

## CHAPTER 6




From flicking through the pages earlier, the reader had noticed that chapter 9 starts with a number of statements about specific letters located throughout the book.
The first was that "The first letter on page 1 of this book is 'T'".
This appears to be correct.
Then "The first letter on page 2 of this book is 's'".
Glancing at the facing page, this too is verified as correct.
"The fifth letter of the second line on page 7 is 'w'"
Flicking forward 6 pages, the reader finds that the fifth letter of the second line is indeed 'w'.

## CHAPTER 7





"This flow of words and letters, recognizable yet not directly meaningful, has a somewhat soporific effect. There is a rhythm to them; a plodding familliarity, yet there is something alien, perhaps 
ominous. Where is it all leading? Is there anything to uncover, or is it all effectively empty terrain?"

With a resigned resumption of their reading, the reader presses on.
